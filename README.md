## Vet Clinic Database.

Vet Clinic is a relational database management web based application that tracks information about animals, their clinic visits and the details of the clinics employees who attended to them.

This project has been developed using prostgres relational db

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
